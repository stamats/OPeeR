# Open Peer Review - Methodological and statistical peer review of selected scientific articles <p align="center"><img src="hex-OPeeR.png" width="400"></p>

The work of John P.A. Ioannidis (see Ioannidis (2005), Ioannidis (2016), Ioannidis (2022)) 
and the book by Stuart Ritchie (see Ritchie (2020)), among others, make it clear that many 
things in research are not really running optimally. 


This repository contains short peer reviews of selected scientific articles from the 
field of (Bio-)Medicine in the form of "open final-version" comments; see Ross-Hellauer (2017). 
The aim of these peer reviews is to address methodological and statistical weaknesses 
and thus hopefully contribute to improving the situation in (bio-)medical research.
